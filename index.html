                                <p>Hello my name is Nicholas Kidder, I am 25 years old and currently I'm working as a
                                    metal
                                    fabricator at a
                                    sheet metal shop in Fullerton, California but I'm looking to make a career change.
                                    I also recieved a certificate from the Coding Bootcamp at UCI in November of 2019
                                    that says I have met the requirements to become a 
                                    full stack MERN developer. My interest in development started in April 2019, I
                                    started working on
                                    some of my own research and by
                                    the following month I was hooked.I dove in head first and registered for the coding
                                    bootcamp and
                                    from there my interest and passion
                                    only grew.  I completed my certificate program on November 2nd 2019, now I am going to
                                    continue my education
                                    and
                                    work towards recieving my Bachelor's Degree in computer science and then proceed to my Masters. Continuing my education is one
                                    of the biggest
                                    aspects of
                                    tech and web development that attracted me to it so much. I
                                    truly enjoy learning new skills and I know that development is a field that is
                                    constantly
                                    growing and changing
                                    and it is a career that involves a lifetime of learning. In my free time I enjoy
                                    going to the
                                    gym, hiking and bike riding, I find that living an active style
                                    helps me stay focused and relieves stress especially when it comes to working on
                                    tedious tasks
                                    such as
                                    programming. Other
                                    activities I enjoy doing in my free time are spending time with family, friends and my
                                    girlfriend. I
                                    see my self as a people person and found that I get along with everyone and I always
                                    make an
                                    effort to
                                    be someone who is easy to get along and work with. I still try to meet with my project group from the Coding Bootcamp at least once a week to discuss and teach eachother what what we've been working on and brainstorm ideas for apps to develop together.</p>
